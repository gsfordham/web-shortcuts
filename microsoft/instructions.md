1) ``outlook-cleaner.js`` -> For use on outlook.com; as of 2020-Aug-22, removes the "Ad-Free Outlook" sidebar next to the viewing pane. You probably already block the ads with like uBlock or something, but the panel/sidebar stays there, shrinking the message viewer. This gets rid of that panel. It also logs the elements removed, because I suspect that will need to be updated in the future... †



† Personally, it's not even the ads that bother _me_, but the **PANEL** -- Microsoft, if you're gonna battle me and my users on this, you can probably just switch the sidebar to a bottom-oriented banner ad, and people who actually **allow** _unobtrusive_ ads on a site-by-site basis, might not have a need for this, anymore, possibly might even stop using AdBlock/uBlock on Outlook... Just a thought, crazy as it is!
