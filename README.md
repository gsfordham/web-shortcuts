# DESCRIPTION #
Basically, this is just a simple repo with some web shortcuts for various sites I use. You might find them useful for yourself, as well.

Some of these might wind up being duplicates of previous, separate repos I've made with similar content, but I figured it might make more sense to stick them all in here, instead.

# INSTRUCTIONS #
1) Search for the type of script you are looking for -- the top-level directory will be the website or context in which it is used. (For example, I will be opening this repo with some scripts used to count purchase data on Humble Bundle -- keys and download items -- so look under the top-level directory, "humble-bundle".)
1) If you see something you like, you can feel free to download the file itself (the JavaScript file), or you can simply copy the code.
1) The code can be put into a bookmark starting with ``javascript:``. By default, all scripts will have this. SOME scripts might, however, have a full, _raw_ version, because it is complex and hard to read as the one-liner code used for bookmark JS. In such a case, if you wish to make modifications, it will be made available.

# USAGE #
1) Add the bookmark, as above.
1) Give the bookmark an identifying name.
1) Try it out in the correct context -- context will be listed in an instructions note in the directory.
1) If something stops working, you can whine to me in the ISSUES page. If I still use it myself, I might try to fix it.
